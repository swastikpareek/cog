# Nimbus: Acquia D8 Starter Theme

Nimbus is a developer focused base theme and starterkit and a minimalist starting point for custom theming. Make sure to read through [our code examples](_theming-guide) to add in more extensive functionality. Nimbus provides the least amount of code to alter to get started, but is still packed with enough utility and documentation to get up and running quickly.

Nimbus includes some barebones integration with: 

* Core *.yml and theme dependencies
* SMACSS css architecture
* Modular gulpfile for front end builds
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node

## Creating a Starter Theme with Drush

* In your `themes` directory, create `contrib` and `custom` directories
* Download Nimbus into `themes/contrib`
* Set Nimbus as your default theme: `drush config-set system.theme default nimbus`
* To create a subtheme using the default options use `drush nimbus "MyTheme"`
* `MyTheme` will be available in `themes/custom`
* Set `MyTheme` as your default theme: `drush config-set system.theme default mytheme`

In your command line type `drush help nimbus` to get a list of all available options for creating your new theme.

## Get started developing

Once you have create a custom subtheme, follow the setup documentation in [README-SETUP.md](https://github.com/acquia-pso/nimbus/blob/8.x/STARTERKIT/README-SETUP.md) in order to set up your local environment and begin theming.

## Front End Architecture

### Primary Files & Folder Structure

The core files are fairly minimal when setting up a new theme. These files are considered as the initial configurable pieces. 

```

Nimbus Subtheme Folders

|-- css/  (generated css) 
|-- gulp-tasks/ (modular gulp task files)
|-- images/  (theme images)
|-- js/  (compiled js)
|-- sass/  (SMACSS based sass setup)
|-- gulpfile.js  (configured gulp file) 
|-- install-node.sh (bash script to install nvm and node)
|-- logo.png (placeholder theme logo file)
|-- logo.svg (placeholder theme logo file)
|-- node_modules/  (modules generated by npm)
|-- package.json  (configured to load dependencies by npm)
|-- README-SETUP.md (Quickstart documentation for subtheme)
|-- screenshot.png (placeholder theme screenshot file)
|-- [theme-name].info.yml (theme config file)
|-- [theme-name].libraries.yml (starter libraries file to load theme assets)
|-- [theme-name].theme (file to use for preprocess functions)
|-- theme-settings.php (file to use for making theme settings available in the GUI)


```

### Sass & CSS Files

Setup of the Sass files so that they are properly broken out in partials and according to the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) methodologies.

Nimbus Subtheme Sass Folder

```
|-- sass
  |-- base/
  |-- layout/
  |-- components/
  |-- state/
  |-- style-guide-only/
  |---- homepage.md
  |---- kss-only.scss
  |-- _config.scss
  |-- style.scss
```

**base/ partials** :: intended as the baseline styles that you extend upon and will include things like resets, global typography, or common form selectors.

**layout/ partials** :: structural layout that can apply to both the outer containers like the sidebars or headers, but also on inner structual pieces.

**components/ partials** :: these module files are the reusable or component parts of our design.

**state/ partials** :: modules will adjust when in a particular state, in regards to targeting how changes happen on contextual alterations for regions or similar  

**style-guide-only/** :: contains homepage.md which provides the content for the Overview section of the styleguide, and kss-only.scss which generates a css file for styling needed by a component for display in the style guide, but not loaded into the actual theme  

**_config.scss** :: this configuration is housing common mixins, variables, or similar, normally you would want to break these out in separate partials

**styles.scss** :: the manifest file that imports all the partials or folders with globbing


### JavaScript Files

An example JS file is provided, it is likely that multiple JS files will be greated and loaded in appropriate situations via library files.

```
Nimbus Theme Folder
|-- js/
  	|-- example.js
```

**example.js** :: this files is intended to illustrate the Drupal.behaviors() placeholder for future development
