## Cog

Cog is a developer-focused base theme and starterkit created by Acquia's Professional Service Front-end Team. It is intended as a minimalistic baseline for custom theming, while exposing common tools and workflows. Cog provides a small amount of code to get started, but is still packed with utilities to extend.

* Responsive containers built on Susy grid system
* Initial SMACSS file architecture
* Common Twig files and theme dependencies
* Base preprocess functions for class definitions
* Modular gulp tasks for compiling and linting
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node
